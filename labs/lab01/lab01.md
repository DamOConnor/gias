5.  Inspect the files in the **Downloads** folder.  It should be called "*extract.zip*".  It will have a number suffix (eg "*extract (2).zip*") if you have done this before.  
This will take a few minutes depending on the number of files you have selected

6.  Right-click the zip file and click **Extract all...**  
Extract the files to a folder and then inspect it.

> [!TIP]
> Copy the path of the folder onto your clipboard as you will need it later.

## Exercise 1.1
Spend some time analysing the folder and folder contents.

## Questions
- How many files have been downloaded?
- What type of files are in the zip?  eg all csv, or zip or both?
- Why couldn't we just do directly this in a Data Pipeline or Notebook?
