# Lab 02 - Set up Fabric
Setup a Fabric Capacity, Workspace and Lakehouse in order to import the data.


## Steps

1.  Set up a Fabric Capacity or Trial.  
If you do not already have a Fabric Capacity or [trial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/get-started/fabric-trial), work with your instructor to set these up.

2.  Create a Workspace:
- Go to https://powerbi.com
- Click **Workspaces** on the left-hand-side then **+ New Workspace**:

- Specify a unique workspace name, eg use "*ws_schools*" and **add your initials** to the end to make it unique, eg "*ws_schools_doc*".

- Check the Advanced section to make sure the workspace is associated with EITHER a Trial Capacity OR a Fabric Capacity:

- Click **Apply** to create the workspace

> [!NOTE]
> Workspaces are backed by Fabric Capacities

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you can't see these options, you have not have access to a Fabric Capacity, Trial, it may not be enabled for your organisation or you do not have permissions to view it.  Work with your instructor to get access.

3. Create a Lakehouse
- Click the Workload Switcher in the bottom left-hand corner of the screen.  Select **Data Engineering**
